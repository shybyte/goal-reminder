This extension reminds you regularly of your important goals in life or just to pause for some sport or do a short walk to refresh your mind.

It displays a minute timer in the right top corner of your browser. When the count down is down it shows a random goal.
You can configure length of countdown or disable it temporally.
You can also import or export your goals.


This extension is open source so you can make sure it's doing nothing evil. Please visit the development website for source code and an issue tracker. 
I would love to hear your ideas how to make this extension better.
